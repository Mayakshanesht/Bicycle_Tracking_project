# Bicycle_Tracking_project
The workflow of project consists of following steps:
                    1) Object/Bicycle Detection using PreTrained YOLOv3
                    2) Implement 2 dimensional kalman filter with Constant velocity Process Model
                    3) Integrate these two algorithms to detect and Track bicycle in the video stream
